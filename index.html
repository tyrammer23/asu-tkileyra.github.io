        <h1>Tyler's Homepage</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Tyler and I am an Informatics major.  I was a Computer Science major for my first 3 years here at ASU.
            Playing hockey, reading, and coding are activites I enjoy outside of school.

        <h1>My Goals</h1>
        <p>
            My goals are to play professional hockey and after I am done playing, work in either cybersecurity, gaming, or honestly any other coding related
            job because I do enjoy most aspects of programming (not data science).
